"""
Persistent background event loop for dispatching coroutines from sync code.

Why not asyncio.run()
---------------------
``asyncio.run()`` creates a fresh loop, runs the coroutine, then *closes the loop
immediately*.  httpx schedules ``AsyncClient.aclose()`` as a background task via
``loop.create_task()``; those tasks are sitting in the ready queue when the
top-level coroutine returns.  ``asyncio.run()`` closes the loop before they
execute, causing:

    RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
    Task exception was never retrieved
    future: <Task finished ... coro=<AsyncClient.aclose() ...>

Why run_coroutine_threadsafe on a persistent loop fixes it
----------------------------------------------------------
The loop never closes, so httpx cleanup tasks run to completion at whatever
depth and pace they need.  The same loop ``id`` is reused across calls, so
Mellea's ``OpenAIBackend._async_client`` cache returns the same
``AsyncOpenAI``/httpx ``AsyncClient`` instance instead of creating a new one
(and abandoned one) per call.

Thread-safety
-------------
``_get_loop()`` uses a double-checked lock so only one loop is ever created.
The daemon thread is never joined — it exits automatically when the process ends.

Usage
-----
    from fact_reasoner.core._async_runner import run_coroutine

    result = run_coroutine(some_async_fn(...))
